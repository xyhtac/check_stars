> **_ðŸ“œ_** Thou shalt divine the most auspicious moments for thine upgrades and labors, lest unseen forces conspire against thy uptime. For verily, it is written: "Know the stars, and thy infrastructure shall know peace!" In the troubled times of deploy spellcraft, the wise DevOps sorcerer shall not trust in KB alone, but also in the heavens above â€” for fate and folly walk hand in hand! Behold, the monitoring plugin, forged in the sacred fires of Nagios and bound by the sigils of systemd, shall reveal unto thee the retrograde wanderings of the planets.

This **Icinga plugin** tracks planetary retrogrades in your dashboard, helping DevOps teams plan maintenance, avoid cursed deployments, and blame Mercury instead of Jenkins. 

## ðŸ”­ Features
```
âœ… Live retrograde status for planets on the dashboard
âœ… Smart alerts for cosmically risky deploy windows
âœ… Event logging - to blame planets, not engineers
âœ… 100% astrologically accurate*

(* Not really.)
```

Plugin works as a host/service config dummy definitions that hold celestial events up to 2030. 
No external calls, no network traffic, no computational overhead.
